This is currently the equivalent of the C# program GlideCLI that I wrote, but this is in C.  This is primarily for me to get more experience with C. But it is also so that this can have a GUI, and so this can be portable to any other operating system with a GUI.

Once this is working as a command line program like GlideCLI, I will get to work on building a graphical user interface, as well as some other features, such as a course builder.

Once the other features and the graphical user interface have been completed, then I will build mathematical courses for people to learn. I intend to include all of the mathematics for people to learn.

I intend to make this software available in distributions that use the apt and rpm package management systems.

I also intend on building some algorithms that compensate for missed study sessions. These newer algorithms will likely not be as accurate as I would like them to be at first. But they will still get the job done to some extent. If no study sessions are missed, or if sessions are only rarely missed, then the program's results are currently very good.
